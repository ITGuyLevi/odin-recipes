        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Sketti (or "spaghetti" if your not fun), is a super easy meal that can be made 
            in under 30 minutes.  It is always a goto meal when we are short of time, or 
            just cannot be bothered to make something else.
        </p>
        <p>One of the best parts is this recipe is that it is great to make even 
            with kids because you can almost hand off the whole process to them!
        </p>
